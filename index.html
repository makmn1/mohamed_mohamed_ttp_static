<!-- 
    I don't have much experience with Date, so this took a while since I had to see what is the most 
    effective strategy to come up with. Eventually I settled on the get methods for hours, minutes, and seconds.
    Then I printed them out but I realized a problem: the get methods return the exact value, meaning that if 
    the hour, minute, or second is single digit, then we won't have a zero in front of it.

    To solve this, I decided to use an if condition to append a zero for single digit values. However, I'd need to 
    convert these numbers to strings. That brought up another problem of concatenating values, because sometimes 
    I'll be concatenating only strings, sometimes only integers, and sometimes a mix of both. To solve this, I 
    converted all the return values to strings to keep the concatenation consistent (and to prevent a whole load 
    of if conditions).

    Suprisingly, the dynamic part was the easiest once I found the setInterval function which I have worked with in the past.
